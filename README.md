# OS-2
A hobby operating system built in C for learning and experimentation 


Previously, I worked on OS-1, which was a simple kernel written in asm. It was running in 16 bit real mode.

This OS is an increment of OS-1. It is written in C and runs in 32 bit protected mode.

I will be jotting down my learnings and progress here:
